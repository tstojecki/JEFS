Javascript Editor for SharePoint (JEFS) is a lightweight, in-browser editor that lets you quickly prototype and test custom javascript code in SharePoint. 
The aim of JEFS is to provide a simple, alternative approach to commonly used CEWP or SPD when applying javascript code against SharePoint pages.
